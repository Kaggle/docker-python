# Tensorflow GCS Configuration Ops

This package provides TF 2.X compatible versions of the
`tf.contrib.cloud.configure_gcs()` operations.

This is a slightly modified and repackaged version of the GCS code in TensorFlow I/O,
in particular the [tfio.gcs](https://www.tensorflow.org/io/api_docs/python/tfio/gcs) module.

This is a copy of the internal source released as the
[tensorflow-gcs-config](https://pypi.org/project/tensorflow-gcs-config/) package.
